# About me

Hi, I'm Varsha Tomar, a Data Scientist with a background in engineering. I'm passionate about extracting insights from data and applying creativity to everything I do. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me expressing my creativity through art and experimenting in cooking. Let's connect and create something amazing together!

# Projects

### Project 1: Know Your Neighbor

https://github.com/VTomar88/KnowYourNeighbor.git

This is the snippet of the code for the app that I am building. In this part, one can know with city and state, how many asian total, asian chinease and asian indians are around a zip code or city-state. The data is from US census.

### Project 2: Covid-19 impact on Unemployment rates and Housing Price Index

https://github.com/VTomar88/Covid-19-housing-unemployment.git

The world has shocked with Covid-19 effects with quarantines, lockdowns, shutting of business, and job loss. In this study, I wish to understand if the impact on Housing Price Index during Covid-19 is due to loss in the employment. To perform the data analysis, I obtained three datasets from open-source government agencies, cleaned the data-sets and merge them to a final dataset. Final data set have variables: State, Year, Employed, Unemployed, HPI_SA, HPI_NSA, Total covid cases, and Total covid deaths. This study presents an exploratory data analysis on three different US datasets to understand the volatility in housing price index and employment before and during Covid-19.

### Project 3: Alien Invasion Game

https://github.com/VTomar88/alien_invasion_python.git

The Alien Invasion Game is designed to learn the fundamentals of building a large-scale project with Python. Using Pygame, the game involves a ship that players can move left and right to fire bullets at a fleet of aliens. Players earn points for hitting alien ships and advance levels upon clearing the fleet.

### Project 4: Factors affecting Health Insurance in US

https://github.com/VTomar88/Factors_affecting_insurance_rates.git

A linear regression model was successfully developed to predict insurance charges based on various features, including age, BMI, sex, smoking status, number of children, and region. Initially, the categorical variables were transformed into numerical values by creating a new data frame containing dummy variables. Subsequently, the data frame was divided into training and testing sets. By using the 'charges' column as the target variable, the linear regression model was fitted, resulting in a satisfactory R-squared value of 0.799 on the test set. This indicates that the model's predictions will deviate from the actual values by no more than 20%, as depicted in the 'Real vs Prediction' charges comparison graph. Insurance companies can employ this model to forecast charges for prospective customers and identify the primary factors driving insurance costs. Future research should focus on enhancing the model's performance and exploring alternative machine learning algorithms for comparative analysis.
