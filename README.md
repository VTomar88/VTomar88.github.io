# About me

Hi, I'm Varsha Tomar, a Data Science Master's student with a background in engineering. I'm passionate about extracting insights from data and applying creativity to everything I do. When I'm not diving into data, you'll find me expressing my creativity through art and experimenting in the kitchen. Let's connect and create something amazing together!

### Project 1: Factors Affecting Health Insurance Charges for XYZ Insurance Company
The aim of this project is to investigate the factors that influence health insurance charges for XYZ Health Insurance Company, a major insurance provider in the USA. To achieve this, a dataset spanning one year was collected. The data was thoroughly cleaned to identify and address any missing values. Categorical variables such as sex, smoker status, and region were converted into numerical values using dummy variables. Subsequently, exploratory data analysis techniques were employed, including creating various graphs. Finally, the dataset was split into 80% training and 20% testing data to assess the suitability of a linear regression model in fitting the dataset. The key drivers of insurance charges were picked by developing a predictive model for potential customers.

### Project 2: Salary Prediction for Data Scientists: A Machine Learning Approach
This project contains a comprehensive analysis of hiring trends and average salaries in the data science field, based on data scraped from the Glassdoor website. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and model building to predict the salary of a data scientist. The goal of this project is to identify key factors that impact salaries and develop a reliable predictive model.

### Project 3: An Explanatory Data Analysis on the impact of Covid-19 on the US Housing Market
Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in January 2020, the world has seen drastic lifestyle changes, including economic disruptions. A few mentions of covid related changes include the quarantines, necessary lockdowns, shutting down of businesses, and vaccine. Though some argue that the changes were chaotic, some in favor that these changes allowed humans to reflect on their fast-paced life. The housing market (both new home buyers and buyers who wish to move away from crowded city lifestyles) have impacted the house marketing prices. Further, there was a record-breaking increase in the unemployment rate in year 2020 and 2021. 
The hypothesis of this study is that there is a negative impact on employment and house price index before and during Covid-19.
Home buyers and research scholars are regularly keeping updated on housing prices, real estate, and mortgage market. With inflation and dynamic economics, it is hard to predict whether it is worth waiting to buy a house or move on with the best deal available now. This study analyzes the US data to understand the volatility in the housing price index and employment before and during Covid-19.

### Customer Segmentation in a Supermarket Mall Using Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques
This project provides insight into customer segmentation in a supermarket mall using unsupervised machine-learning techniques. The project aims to identify distinct customer groups based on demographic information and spending behavior, leveraging unsupervised machine learning algorithms like K-means and Density-Based Clustering (DBSCAN). The dataset obtained from Kaggle contains customer information, including age, gender, annual income, and spending score. Exploratory data analysis revealed valuable insights about the dataset, including customer age distribution, income levels, and spending patterns. Feature engineering involves converting categorical data to numerical and identifying correlations among variables. The K-means analysis resulted in five customer clusters representing financially conservative, balanced, high-end shoppers, impulsive buyers, and frugal spenders. However, DBSCAN's performance was limited due to weak density patterns and a small number of outliers in the dataset. Ethical considerations were considered to protect customer privacy. Challenges included data comprehensiveness, feature selection, interpreting results, and evaluating algorithm performance.

### Project 4: Remote Jobs in the Post-COVID-19 Era
The percentages of remote and hybrid jobs have drastically increased from 2020 onwards. In this article, I have presented a total of five questions regarding the future of remote jobs and gathered information and data that favor or disagree with the problem. One of the interesting findings was on my hypothesis that most professionals in post COVID world would prefer to do more remote jobs. The data suggests that most employees would prefer hybrid jobs than remote or on-site jobs. Further, the number of remote jobs posted on the internet based on skills pre and post-pandemic is presented. It appears that areas requiring soft skills are the easy target for remote jobs, which to date, are still increasing in the number of postings. Further, I have discussed mental and well-being issues raised due to the increase in remote jobs during the pandemic. Employees are afraid that post-pandemic would lead to a decrease in their employment benefits and rewards they were earning during the pandemic. Finally, I have presented ethical issues of remote jobs and challenges or opportunities raised by the data in this study.

### Project 5: Weather app – Python
The Weather Forecast Application is a Python program that interacts with the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain weather forecast data for a given city or zip code. The program provides a user-friendly interface to input the location and choose the desired temperature unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin). It then retrieves the weather information from the API and displays it in a readable format to the user.

### Project 6: United States Public School ratings depend on economic and demographic characteristics.
School district ratings have been long debated for a moving family or homebuyers. For instance, I recently moved from Nebraska to Maryland in June 2022. Constantly it was bothering me and my husband that how can we get a home in a high rating school district area, though we have a 2-year-old child, and he has still time to go to the school. Such apprehension is most common among the families with growing children. 

In this project, I wish to understand if economic (like poverty) and demographics (areas with more immigrants/race) impact US school ratings. 

### Project 7: ML-based Model to Identify ‘Threatening Personalities’ in a Team
Often physical strength is correlated to threatening personalities. In today’s technological era, judging a personality just by physical stature, gender, or looks might be misleading and often results in loss of real skill sets from a company. Further, measuring current employees' mental health can help build a safe environment and the company's success.
In summary, identifying threatening personalities in a team is vital to promoting a healthy and productive work environment. It can improve communication, collaboration, and performance, ultimately benefiting the team and the organization.

### Project 8: Delta Airlines: A Safer Travel Option
The study's objective was to assess the safety of air travel and examine the efforts made by airlines to enhance it over the years. The analysis primarily focused on comparing the number of fatalities during air travel from 1962 to 2019 with road accidents in Maryland from 2015 to 2022.
