### Project 2: Alien Invasion Game
The Alien Invasion Game is designed to learn the fundamentals of building a large-scale project with Python. Using Pygame, the game involves a ship that players can move left and right to fire bullets at a fleet of aliens. Players earn points for hitting alien ships and advance levels upon clearing the fleet.
