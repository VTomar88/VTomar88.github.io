### Project 2: Covid-19 impact on Unemployment rates and Housing Price Index

https://github.com/VTomar88/Covid-19-housing-unemployment.git

The world has shocked with Covid-19 effects with quarantines, lockdowns, shutting of business, and job loss. In this study, I wish to understand if the impact on Housing Price Index during Covid-19 is due to loss in the employment. To perform the data analysis, I obtained three datasets from open-source government agencies, cleaned the data-sets and merge them to a final dataset. Final data set have variables: State, Year, Employed, Unemployed, HPI_SA, HPI_NSA, Total covid cases, and Total covid deaths. This study presents an exploratory data analysis on three different US datasets to understand the volatility in housing price index and employment before and during Covid-19.

### Project 3: Alien Invasion Game

https://github.com/VTomar88/alien_invasion_python.git

The Alien Invasion Game is designed to learn the fundamentals of building a large-scale project with Python. Using Pygame, the game involves a ship that players can move left and right to fire bullets at a fleet of aliens. Players earn points for hitting alien ships and advance levels upon clearing the fleet.
